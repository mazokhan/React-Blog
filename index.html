    <p>My opinion about the javascript library react is that of an very interesting coding style. I thoroughly enjoyed learning
        react.the Different components makes the code a lot easier to read and understand. By breaing them down into separate files
        it allows the content to be easily brought together. </p><br>

     Another interesting thing about react is the use of Hooks. Hooks make it a lot easier to store data and be used again.<br>
     <p>The interesting part of this project was to understand how the functions work together to form the repsonses for the information to be displayed.I had plenty of problems with my local host
    not woking and then i somehow managed to get the local host to display the website.</p> <br>
    <p> I added css which a lot of it i found on google and youtube as i have been learning some tips and tricks to make pretty websites.
    I am not that skilled with bootstrap, however i used bootstrap for the buttons part. I will learn how to use bootstrap a lot more detail in the future.  </p>
